lore: Sun, born from a rock, has been extraordinary since the very beginning. Once he was pinned down under a mountain by gods, unable to move even a little bit. He watched time changing and watched the world being changed by the time. Snow covered his body parts that were exposed outside the mountain, but could never freeze his heart full of enthusiasm for freedom. When the opportunity showed, he chanted 'freedom' loudly and broke down his imprisonment. Then he laughed and flew away. Now, Sun has come to the Land of Dawn. In here, this stone-born monkey with a soul that cannot be tied down will start his own legend again.
