lore: "When just a child, both of Alucard's parents were killed by demons and
      he was imprisoned and suffered cruelties at their hands for several months,
      until finally he was rescued by demon hunters and raised by them.
      From a young age, he was raised to be an outstanting demon hunter,
      with an extreme enmity for the demon race. The three iron laws of the demon hunters are:
      Swear no allegiance to any army; Spare not a single one of demonkind.
      Never stop carrying out missions."
