lore: Alpha is another creation of Laboratory 1718 after Saber left. Mad scientists
      got a new idea from a famous sci-fi movie. Using human bodies as biological material
      and space meteorolite as metal skeletons, they created powerful twins. Alpha and Beta,
      as known as 'Flesh Weapon', are capable of utilizing a supernatural power that's ubiquitous
      but very mystery. However, the twins had themselves conscious awakened since they were
      born, and refused to become killing machines. Getting help from Saber, they escaped from
      the alt-world. However, on their way to escape, the made man Beta's core was destroyed.
      All that Alpha could bring out was Beta's half metal arm. After coming to the Land of Dawn,
      with the help of master machinist Rooney, now Beta keeps company with Alpha as a form of
      an aircraft.
