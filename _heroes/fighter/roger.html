lore: Roger lives outside the dark forest to the east of the Megalith Wasteland. He is a hunter rich in experience who
      hunts for his livelihood. Many dangerous animals live in the dark forest, and the most fearsome among them aren't rare
      magical creatures but the old wolf king "White Tooth" who leads a pack of wolves one hundred strong.  They are cooperative pack hunters,
      and White Tooth also received the influence of an evil power that awakened magical abilities within him. To fulfill their hunting needs, the wolf pack gradually starting prowling outside the boundaries of the dark forest, often attacking travelers on the road. In the spirit of justice, Roger planned to get rid of this public harm and tracked White Tooth's steps. Roger caught up with and blindsided White Tooth just as he was devouring a little girl, and Roger cut open the wolf's belly. Roger had defeated White Tooth, but the evil power lurking within White Tooth contaminated the hunter. "Even the purest of heart, a man who never forgets to say his prayers at night, will be unable to avoid turning into a werewolf under the full moon." Under the moon's call, Roger was shocked to find out the old legends were true. He had become a werewolf. To avoid losing his senses while transformed and harming his family, Roger had no choice but to flee far away from his home.
