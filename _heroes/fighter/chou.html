He cared for elders and minors in slum with passion. However, with the turmoil and instability of the Land of Dawn raised, situation outside has impacted this isolated slum eventually. On occasion, Chou saved an old monk who were being chased. He brought him back to the slum and looked atter him. In return, the old monk imparted the ancient Asian Kung-Fu skill to Chou, and told him that the world needed a real hero to stand up and end the turmoils. After finishing his appreticeship, Chou swore before the old monk that he would become a real hero.Then he started his journey to the centre of the Land of Dawn without even one looking back. Towards Chou's distant silhouette, the old monk noded, and drifted away.
