lore: The renowned Bloodaxe Orcs are the descendants of interbreeding between blood demons and other devils, and their custom of using arcane magic to infect the entire bodies of their enemies and animals with blood is a testament to this fact. They are bloodthirsty and war-loving, and the strongest among them is named Balmond.
