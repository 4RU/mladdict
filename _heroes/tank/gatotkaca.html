lore: Gatotkaca 'Iron Steel' was the son of Bima and Arimbi from Arcapada universe. Since his childhood, he's been a champion of Gods, fighting vicious enemies of his homeland. Once lost and beaten near death, Gatotkaca rose as a mighty warrior from Pandava clan who possessed the supernatural power he got from the ultimate training inside the cauldron of heaven, Candradimuka. With his Antakusuma armor and Brajamusti-Brajadenta twin gauntlet, he can fly across the skies like lightning and hunt down his enemies, the furious Ashuras. Gatotkaca, the Knight of Priggadani is a symbol of bravery and devotion. *Based on 'Garudayana' comic series created by Yuniarto, inspired by Indonesian traditional shadow puppets.
