Even the vilest of enemies did not dare to challenge Tigreal on the battlefield, because they knew such a foolish action would only be met with Tigreal's merciless blade. The name of Tigreal, a believer in th Lord of Light, has become synonymous with bravery and fearlessness. His kingdom has conferred upon him the honorable title of Warrior of Light as a reward.
