lore: Johnson, with a hardy constitution as a rock, when he ran through the dome stadium like a heavy truck, the cheers of girls burst out loud. He led the team to lift the champion's trophies and achieved his peak of his life as a super quarterback with millions fans around. However, fortune is always fickle. A little girl rushed to the road in a sudden while Johnson was driving his sport car. To avoid hitting on the little girl, his car crashed severely.  Massive hemorrhage was going to take away his life soon in a minute. At that moment, a miracle occurred, that the wreckage of the sport car started to blend into Johnson's body by a mystery force. Consequently, he not only just survived from the crash, also became a magical new human who can transform to a sport car.
