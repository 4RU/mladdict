lore: Scholars and thinkers from all over the world gather at the city of Antoinerei. It is here where the commonly overlooked Digger lives. Many don't give a second look to Digger due to his small frame, until they come upon his researches in chronoscience. Digger loves clocks, he believes that within these little mechanical toys lies many more yet to be discovered secrets. Through the use of his 'Time Nest' Digger can control the flow of time. He is also able to release his friends from the physical shackles of time, taking them along with him. Beware though, for if you anger him, be prepared for the taste of a Hoot Hoot 'Time Bomb'!
