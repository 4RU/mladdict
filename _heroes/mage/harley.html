lore: "There  lived a famous young mage - Harley in the Lion Academy of Magical City. He  was blessed by the Magical Goddess and was the star of the Academy, since he  was able to learn quickly and master any magical spell. Kids often need  adventure, so when Harley and his friends were exploring the jungle in the  middle of the night, they overheard the evil conspiracy of an organization  called 'Dark Wizards'. The brave young men decided to stop them!  First, they needed to find the secret base of Dark Wizards and report to the  headmaster. But during the investigation, he accidentally activated a space  portal and teleported to the other side of the Land of Dawn - Scholar City.  With the help of the mecha master - Rooney, the brave and energetic boy and  his partner Lolita, Bruno, Alpha and Saber went back to the Magical City to  destroy the core of Demorte, the Boss of Dark Wizards. To improve his battle  techniques, Harley started his adventure in the Land of Dawn."
