lore: "Aurora,born in a windstorm and with a great power of controlling ice and snow, is the queen of the northernmost land â€“ Nost Gal, the dominator of the Frozen Sea and the Guardian of the Land of Dawn. Although they are all on this northern most land, Aurora never had any interest in the conflicts between Franco and Bane.She was born powerful and extraordinary. As one of the four Guardians of the Land of Dawn, she undertakes all those responsibilities of protecting the world, protecting its border and ensuring its safety from the space time rifts and monsters. During a horrible plane fight, Aurora lost one arm, along with her guardian knight. After this experience, the young queen became solemn and cold,silent and full of sorrow. When she riding on the wind travels, there's only snow and ice keeping her company."
