lore: Alaghat is a mysterious hi-tech empire, where the strange race of Yasson lives. With human looks but deformed feet, they are agile and born to fight. They excel at technology too, and built themselves a great civilization with the power to invade other nations. Since young, Karrie was very gifted and went through cruel training to become an excellent but arrogant warrior leader – however at the same time, she had also become void of all emotions and turned into a cold-hearted machine.One time, she was overconfident in battle and became seriously injured. A prophet from another race saved her and injected his consciousness into her brain. Since then, a voice has been echoing in her head, revealing to her that the end the Yasson empire was imminent and the race will soon become extinct. Still dazed from this near-death experience, Karrie didn’t know what to believe, and after returning to her empire she was still filled with doubt. Finally, in order to save her empire, and herself, Karrie decided to believe the prophecy and came to the Land of Dawn to search for a way to break the spell in her head.What kind of destiny could be waiting for her?
