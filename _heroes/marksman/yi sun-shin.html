lore: Chungmugong Yi Sun-sin was a famous general in an Asian kingdom. He was extremely loyal and of prowess. At the time when the nation was in danger, Yi Sun-sin built a powerful navy and created the iron armored 'turtle ship', making indelible contribution to Korea Kingdom for dominating around sea areas. 'Wherever iron turtle ships sail on, the sea areas belong to me.' said Yi. Yi was excellent at 'overtaking majority with the minority'. Under the leadership of Him, Korean navy defeated over 330 enemy warships with only 12 ships, gaining the great triumph of Battle of Myeongnyang. To this day, the legend of this Asian general still lives on in the people's hearts.
