lore: The world Layla lives in is full of a force called Malefic Energy, a savage and unruly energy that causes all living things that come in contact with it to lose their reason and become rabidly ferocious. This energy had all but wiped out her world, until one day Layla's father discovered a way to use a gun forged from magic iron from deep within the earth to absorb and control Malefic Energy. Unfortunately, he absorbed too much energy during the forging process and died, but not before giving the completed gun to Layla in the hopes that she would halt the spread of Malefic Energy.
