lore: Irithel was abandoned as a child in the jungle by her parents. Under the guidance of the God of the Jungle, a female smilodon that had just given birth adopted her. Under protection of the mother smilodon, the little smilodon Leo and Irithel learned to hunt, survive - she grew up like an animal. During a territorial fight, the mother smilodon was badly injured. When Irithel and her 'brother' Leo went into town for help, these 'smilodon children' were captured by a slave trader. When the cat elf mage - Nana passed by, she couldn't bear to watch them get beaten by the slave trader, so she used her supernatural strength to save these 2 poor children. With the help of Nana, Irithel learned to speak as a human and also learned how to fight, while Leo grew up to be a strong adult smilodon. However, to this day Irithel still hates human kind and trusts only her friend - Leo.
