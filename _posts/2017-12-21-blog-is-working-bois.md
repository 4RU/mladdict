See your body into the moonlight

Even if I try to cancel

All the pictures into the mind

There's flashing in my eyes

<br>

Don't you see my condition?

The fiction is gonna run it again

Can't you see now illusions?

Right into your mind

<br>

Déja Vu!

I've just been in this place before

Higher on the street

And I know it's my time to go

<br>

Calling you and the search is a mistery

Standing on my feet

It's so hard when I try to be me

Wooh!

<br>

Déja Vu!

I've just been in this time before

Higher on the beat

And I know it's a place to go

<br>

Calling you and the search is mistery

Standing on my feet

It's so hard when I try to be me

Yeah!

<br>

See the future into the present

See my past lives in the distance

Try to guess now what's going on

And the band begins to play

<br>

Don't you see my condition?

The fiction is gonna run it again

Can't you see now illusions?

Right into your mind

<br>

Déja Vu!

I've just been in this place before

And I know it's my time to go

<br>

Calling you and the search is mistery

Standing on my feet

It's so hard when I try to be me

Wooh!

<br>

Déja Vu!

I've just been in this time before

Higher on the beat

And I know it's a place to go

<br>
