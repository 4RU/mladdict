Introduction - Why pick Lancelot
Screw these lores and tales. Let's just play Lancelot. 

Warning: This is going to be a rather complex and detailed guide. The goal is to explain this hero to players who don't know lancelot or are fairly new to the game. However, especially the match up and how-to-play section might be interesting for experienced players who look to improve their meta and overview skills. I'm going to explain pushing and ratting strategies and most important, how to win the majority of games with him. 

Lancelot. Perfumed knight. Odette :D. 
This guy has been by far my most played and most loved hero for almost 1 month. Not only I'm picking him 2/3 games, I'm also watching replays, pubs & professional games. 
If you learn how to play this **********er correctly, you'll receive a 70% Win Rate or even higher with this hero. 

Let's get to it!

So why the heck would I want to pick lancelot? 
The question is easy to answer: 

He's (mostly) Beautiful Man. #no**** 
He brings end to sword. 
His attack animation is one of, if not the best in the entire game. 

Dia bisa bergerak lebih cepat (except for fanny).
Damage yang ia hasilkan lebih cancer dari apapun, terutama skill 2 yang ia miliki :/
Ultimatenya dapat meusuk seluruh benda yang ada di LOD. Jika musuh bertarung dalam posisi yang sangat tidak tepat(terutama MM), kamu hanya perlu menggunakan skill 2 dan ultimate dan boom oajsjalsjakalsk pasti tau lah apa yang terjadi :D.

If you want to win your save lane.
If you want to control or punish the movement of the enemy team.
If you know you can end the game between minute 6-10.
You absolutely want and have to cut the enemies body, like 

 Fanny, 

 Hayabusa,

Saber,

Karina, atau mungkin HILDA :D hahaha IMPOSSIBLE diawal  kamu tidak bisa membunuh hilda -_- terkecuali kamu dapat bantuan dari teman mu :D

Okay, gotcha, that's almost always. When should I not pick Lancelot?

Lancelot is capable to fight almost all heroes, but you should be aware of the match up as a whole. Playing Lancelot is always risky. You will never want to fight with your team until you have at least your item jungle dan Sepatu, ideally also your Bloodlust Axe . But as soon as you've got your BA(Bloodlust axe), go into the fights. (Yes, there are exceptions. Explanations follow later.)
A scenario you'd want to avoid: The enemy has the "harder" carry and you're the only carry in your team. You could lack damage in that case. At a certain point Lancelot's influence drops drastically. But even then you can still win the game by using skill 2 properly and keep farming.
Try to avoid: massive silence, massive disable,(unless you have a Diggie in your team).
team).

Alright, alright, would you finally tell me something about the items?

I was waiting for that. Some of you might disagree, but trust me, this should be the most effective and viable choice of items, in that correct order:
Spend your gold on nimble blade
The most important thing for AM indeed is last hitting. That's why you want to get your 

 Jungle Item lvl 2 ( Nimble Blade, Pilager Axe) asap. Get it in minute 1 if possible: 

Setelah item jungle mu siap, kamu bisa membuat sepatu ataupun bisa langsung rush BA (Bloodlust Axe). But if
you've got your Sepatu, there's no point in hesitating to get your BA atau item LS lainnya. I know, we will now have the discussion "Why not Damage item first?", well, the answer is fairly simple: BA will allow you to never go to the base, while farming with Jungle Item only might get you low or medium HP and Mana at a certain point. BA also gives Your HP boost AF . BA provides a Cooldown Reduction.
